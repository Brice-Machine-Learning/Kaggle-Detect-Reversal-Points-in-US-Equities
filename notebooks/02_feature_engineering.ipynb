    "\n",
    "- Ingest validated raw and baseline datasets\n",
    "- Engineer time-aware features derived from Signal Descriptor columns\n",
    "- Construct lag-based and rolling window features without leakage\n",
    "- Encode sparse event information relevant to reversal detection\n",
    "- Maintain compatibility with baseline and advanced modeling pipelines\n",
    "- Persist engineered datasets to `/data/processed/`\n",
    "- Document feature rationale for downstream interpretation\n",

    "## 🔗 **Context from Prior Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering decisions in this notebook are informed by findings from the light EDA phase, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extremely wide feature space dominated by boolean Signal Descriptor columns\n",
    "- Sparse, event-based target labels (`H`, `L`, `None`)\n",
    "- Strong temporal ordering within each `ticker_id`\n",
    "- Need for models robust to high-dimensional, sparse inputs\n",
